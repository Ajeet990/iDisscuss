                <p class="lead">The International Forum for Volunteering in Development (Forum) is the most significant
                    global network of International Volunteer Cooperation Organisations (IVCO). Forum exists to share
                    information, develop good practice and enhance cooperation across the international volunteering and
                    development sectors. It promotes the value of volunteering for development through policy
                    engagement, mutual learning and by sharing innovative and good practices. Forum is a ‘virtual’
                    network, with a global membership that includes a range of organisations involved in international
                    development, including non-government and state organisations.
                </p>
                <h4>What does Forum do?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Information sharing:</b>Forum’s website contains a credible body of research and good
                        practice in international volunteering for development including: conference reports, research
                        papers, relevant links and contact details.</li>
                    <li><b>Research:</b>Forum regularly commissions and shares research on issues related to
                        international volunteering that is relevant to its members and in the wider development
                        discourse.</li>
                    <li><b>Networking:</b>Forum hosts an annual IVCO conference, usually in partnership with one of
                        Forum’s member organisations. Delegates from a range of agencies across the world participate in
                        the conference, and the meeting provides an opportunity for senior staff of international
                        volunteering agencies to network and discuss key issues in volunteering and development.</li>
                    <li><b>Promoting:</b>the value and role of international volunteering for development to be
                        recognised and included in national and international development policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why is Forum important?</h4>
                <p>As a network of credible international volunteering and cooperation agencies with a long track record
                    of experience, Forum has a collective voice and unified identity in the values and principles that
                    underpin volunteering for development. Forum aims to share information, develop good practice and
                    enhance cooperation and support between its members. Together, members explore innovative practice
                    and research key contemporary issues, focusing on organisational learning and improved practice.</p>
                <p>Forum members celebrate and document the significance of volunteering and civil society inclusion
                    through: staying connected; sharing practices; celebrating diversity; promoting inclusiveness and
                    reciprocity; sharing knowledge; having critical debates; influencing external stakeholders; and
                    through learning and supporting each other within the volunteering community.</p>
                <h4>How is Forum resourced?</h4>
                <p>Forum is resourced by membership subscriptions, occasional grants, and the voluntary staff time and
                    funds from the organisations providing the Chair and the Forum Board of Directors. Subscriptions
                    from members enable Forum to operate at a basic level with a part-time Executive Coordinator and the
                    capacity to organise the annual IVCO conference.</p>
                <h4>Forum’s Origins</h4>
                <p>Forum was founded in 1964 in Strasbourg under the auspices of the Council of Europe. Until 2000,
                    Forum was an organisation for European-based agencies. In 2000, membership of Forum was opened up to
                    organisations across the world. In 2002, Forum took over responsibility for running an annual
                    meeting of Heads of International Volunteer Cooperation Organisations – now known as IVCO.</p>
